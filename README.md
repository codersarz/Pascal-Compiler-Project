# Pascal Compiler Project

This repository contains the source code and resources for my Pascal Compiler project, developed using Lex and Yacc on a Unix/Linux environment. The project was conducted from January 2024 to May 2024 and includes the following key components:

- **Lexical Analyzer:**
  - Engineered to tokenize the input Pascal program into meaningful symbols, demonstrating expertise in low-level programming and system tools.
  
- **Syntax Analyzer:**
  - Developed to parse the tokenized input, verifying its syntactic structure against Pascal grammar rules.
  
- **Semantic Analyzer:**
  - Includes modules for type validation and variable usage, ensuring efficient and error-free code compilation with a 95% accuracy rate in type checking.
  
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):**
  - Constructs an abstract representation of the syntax structure of the Pascal program, showcasing strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
  
- **Three-Address Code Generation:**
  - Translates the Pascal program into an intermediate three-address code for further processing by the compiler.
  
- **C Code Output:**
  - Produces C code that prints the output for the input Pascal program, effectively acting as a compiler.
  
- **Testing and Optimization:**
  - Conducted thorough testing and optimization to ensure the compilerâ€™s reliability, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in generating output from compiled programs.

This project serves as a comprehensive implementation of a Pascal compiler, demonstrating the entire compilation process from lexical analysis to generating executable C code.
